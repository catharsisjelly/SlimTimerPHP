SlimTimer PHP Interface
=======================

About
-----
I use SlimTimer to monitor how long I spend on tasks and love how simplistic
and useful it is. I was wanting to automate a weekly export so that I did
not have to remember to do it and was surprised that I could not find a
pure PHP implementation. I found one using the Zend Framework but wanted
one to run independently of that. In general the code will return a
JSON object for you to play with so remember that you may need to
cast the various things you need to pass.

Requirements
------------
PHP 5+ incl curl & simplexml

Testing
-------
To run the tests you must use PHPUnit and add a config file below is
an example of the config file.

	email = "test@foo.com"
	password = "1234"
	coworkers[] = "me@foo.com"
	coworkers[] = "you@foo.com"
	reporters[] = "us@foo.com"
	reporters[] = "them@foo.com"

Example usage
-------------

	$email = '';
	$password = '';

	$s = new SlimTimer($apiKey);
	$authResponse = $s->authenticate($email, $password);

	$tasks = $s->listTasks();
	var_dump($tasks);

	$task = $s->createTask("Test via API");
	$s->updateTask($task->id, null, array('foo', 'bar'));
	$s->showTask($task->id);
	$s->deleteTask($task->id);
	$s->listTimes();
	$s->listTimesForTask($task->id);
	$time = $s->createTime($task->id, date('Y-m-d H:i:s'), 1);
	$s->showTime($time->id);
	$s->updateTime($task->id, $time->id, 10, $time->{'start-time'});
	$s->deleteTime($time->id);
